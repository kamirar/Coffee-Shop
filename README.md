# Coffee-Shop
Simulates a coffee shop checkout system using multiple queues. Runs for a specified duration, during which customers arrive at random intervals and join the shortest queue. Once a customer is served, they leave the queue. The program tracks customer arrival, service start, and completion times, and outputs the data to a file.
